        "- Why? Because trees can fit non-linear, non-[monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function) relationships, and [interactions](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/interaction.html) between features.\n",
        "- A single decision tree, grown to unlimited depth, will [overfit](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/). We solve this problem by ensembling trees, with bagging (Random Forest) or boosting (Gradient Boosting).\n",
        "- Random Forest's advantage: may be less sensitive to hyperparameters. Gradient Boosting's advantage: may get better predictive accuracy.\n",

        "**One-hot encoding isn’t the only way, and may not be the best way, of categorical encoding for tree ensembles.**\n",
        "- For example, tree ensembles can work with arbitrary \"ordinal\" encoding! (Randomly assigning an integer to each category.) Compared to one-hot encoding, the dimensionality will be lower, and the predictive accuracy may be just as good or even better.\n"
